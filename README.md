# FIR-Low-Pass-Filter
FIR Low Pass Filter design using windowing techniques 

# Requirements: 
- Using the Hamming window and the sampling frequency is 2000Hz. 
- Cutoff frequency of passband is 0-100Hz
- The passband attenuation is less than or equal to 0.1dB, and the stopband attenuation is greater than or equal to 50dB.
Here, the cutoff frequency is all normalized frequency, we get this from ω=2πf/fs, where fs is the sampling frequency.
